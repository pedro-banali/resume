# resume
Résumé in HTML with Web Components

## The another little tale
Andre Rabello, a team mate, wanted to update his résumé, and he had a tale to tell. :sweat_smile:

I just figured that I could use what he created and increment a little bit and use this opportunity to learn about WebComponents, WebPack, Typescript. :pensive:

Soon after I forked I started looking into the code and I was like :hushed:

As a eager to learn and a self taught person I started looking into to code and understanding what was happening.
My satisfaction that I could, after a while, read and change it was like . :sweat_smile:

Wow it's just WebComponents how can be so happy about learning such a simple framework? :confused:
Just because, even though it was a simple framework, doesn't mean it's not a challenge that I can solve and also the accomplishment feeling that I learned a new thing :satisfied:

This is pretty much the summary of my life as a developer, always knowing about something and trying to learn it to see if I can catchup and don't fall behind :running:


## Goal
- To build a résumé that looks good, first and foremost, as a .pdf file. If Chrome can render it so that I can print a one pager I'm good
- Secondly, learning about Web Components without framework guardrails
- Thirdly, incrementally building on the résumé so that perhaps it can also be portfolio
- Fourhtly, inject result into a more complete personal web page
- Lastly, Learn about WebComponents, Typescript and WebPack and show a little history how I got here
